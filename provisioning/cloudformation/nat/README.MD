# High Availability on NAT Instance 

On AWS instances on private subnets should not be directly addressable from the Internet. In this case we need NAT instance in public subent for routing the traffic coming out from private instances.

Below a solution that use a Cloudformation template for 1:1 Autoscaling group using a python script that update routing table in case of failover. This is an alternative to the solution described by [Jinesh Varia] (http://aws.amazon.com/articles/2781451301784570)
